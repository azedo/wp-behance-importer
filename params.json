  "body": "# WP Behance Importer\r\n\r\n> Just a easier way to import your existing projects on Behance to your wordpress portfolio.\r\n  \r\n__Version 0.4b__  \r\n__License MIT__  \r\n__Author [Eduardo Grigolo](http://www.eduardogrigolo.com.br)__\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis plugin is ment to help people that want to post their projects in Behance, but also want to keep their personal portfolio/website updated.\r\n\r\nIs fairly simple to get started, all you need is a developer key from behance (wich you can grab yours [here](http://www.behance.com/dev)) and your behance profile link (usually __http://www.behance.net/YOUR_NAME__).\r\n\r\nAfter the configuration, is just a matter of making a search based on the first project ever posted on behance, from an specific date or from today (the day your are using the plugin of course!).\r\n\r\nThen you need to select the projects you want to import e voi-lá! After a few seconds (or minutes, depending on how many you want to import) you'll have your projects in your wordpress site/portfolio awaiting to be published!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n1. Add a progress bar for better showing of the import progress\r\n2. Make the selection \"click\" move from just the checkmark, to the entire line of the project soon to be imported\r\n3. Select wich post type is going to receive the imported projects\r\n4. Select wich is the post field for the images imported\r\n5. ~~Fix the selected tab css (it's showing a line under the tabs name)~~\r\n6. Tranfer the text from the js file to the php in order to translate them\r\n\r\n\r\n### Roadmap\r\n- Add an option to choose the custom post type of the portfólio\r\n- Make a search field to search projects by name or tag\r\n- Give the user an option to import not just images\r\n- Finish the Help section",
